## Your own project

During the second half of the course you will work on a project in any area of mathematics of your choice. You can put your project files in this folder.

Since a project likely consists of more than 1 file, it will be useful to publish this as a repository on GitHub.

## Git Instructions

We will be using git via the interface on VSCode. You can also do it from the command line.

### Getting started

* Create an account on `github.com`
* On the command line, run the following two commands, with your name and email substituted in: (you can open a terminal in VSCode with `ctrl+J`/`cmd+J` and clicking `Terminal`)
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@yourdomain.com"
```
* In VSCode, open this file and add your name at the top.
* Save all your open files
* Click on the `Source Control` button (left bar, likely the third button from the top).
* Write a small commit message (what you write is not important, but it should not be empty). Press `Commit`.
* Press `Yes` (or `Always`) on the prompt `There are no staged changes to commit. Would you like to stage all changes and commit them directly?`. This will also commit your changes to all other files, which is fine.
* Press `Sync changes`
* Press `OK` (or `OK, don't show again`) when prompted `This action will pull and push commits from and to "origin/master"`
* In the new window, press `Sign in with browser`
* If needed, sign in to GitHub
* Press `Authorize git-ecosystem`
* You get the message that you don't have permission to push. Press `Create Fork`.
* You should now see your changes at `github.com/<YourGitHubUsername>/LeanCourse24`.

### Pushing Later Commits

Pushing another commit after the first one is easy:

* Save all your open files
* Write a small commit message and press `Commit`.
* Press `Sync changes`

Make sure to commit your work at least occasionally (and definitely before giving the presentation).
Comitting early and often can help avoid conflicting changes if you're collaborating with a partner on your formalization project.

### Pulling commits

After you create your fork I believe that VSCode will not `sync` or `pull` new changes correctly by itself anymore, since it will pull from your fork by default.

To get new changes, do the following:
* Press the three dots icon at the top-right of the `source control` panel `... > Pull / Push > Pull from ... > upstream/master`
* (optionally) press `sync changes`.

Note: After you have created a fork, `git pull` will likely not work anymore from the command line. You can still pull changes from the command line using `git pull upstream master`.

### Working with a partner

* If you collaborate with another student on a formalization project, you should still both fork this repository.
* To pull the work from your partner, you can add their repository using `source control` panel `... > Remotes > Add remote ...`. For the URL, you should use `https://github.com/<TheirGitHubUserName>/LeanCourse24.git`.
* After this you can pull their work using `... > Pull / Push > Pull from ...`.

### Command-line

If you would like to use Git from your command-line instead, you can use the commands `git pull`, `git add`, `git commit -am "commit message"`, `git push`, `git status`, `git log`, among others. Google for information how to exactly use these commands.

## Formalization Topics

You can choose a topic in any area of mathematics.

A good topic should be
* not yet in mathlib (although it's also fine to give a different proof of something already in mathlib);
* not too hard (don't overestimate how much you can do in your project);
* not require too many prerequisites that are not yet part of mathlib.

On the mathlib website there are some useful pages:
* [topics in mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-overview.html)
* [undergraduate topics in mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad.html)
* [undergraduate topics not yet in mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad_todo.html
)
* [the full contents of mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/) (use the search in the top right)


Some suggested topics:

* In **analysis**: the Fourier transform and convolution have been defined in mathlib. Show that the Fourier transform of a convolution is the product of Fourier transforms.

* In **calculus**: prove the gradient theorem for Euclidean space, also know as the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals. As stretch goals use it to prove the equivalence of two definitions of a conservative vector field and provide an example of a non-conservative vector field.

* In **complex analysis**
  - define the winding number of a closed curve and prove basic properties. You can either use topological path lifting, or its analytic definition (Cauchy's integral formula exists in mathlib). Stretch goal: prove the equivalence of these two definitions.
  - Prove that the Laurent series for a complex function converges on an annulus.

* In **differential geometry**
  - [taken] define differential 1-forms and exact 1-forms (closed 1-forms are harder to define).
    Show that on a simply connected domain, every 1-form is exact. (Mathlib is still missing a general definition of n-forms, but that is too hard for a project)
  - Prove that the product of orientable manifolds is orientable (copy-paste the definition of orientable manifold from Mathlib PR [#16239](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/16239/files) and assume your manifolds have no boundary).
  - Prove that a diffeomorphism between connected manifolds is either orientation-preserving or orientation-reversing (copy-paste the definition of orientable manifold from Mathlib PR [#16239](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/16239/files) and assume your manifolds have no boundary).

* In **functional analysis** define Fredholm operators and prove basic properties.

* As an application of **Galois theory**: constructible numbers have already been done in Lean, but there is a separate notion of constructible numbers with folding/origami. Define the numbers constructible via origami constructions and prove that it forms a field closed under square roots and cube roots. Stretch goal: classify exactly these numbers (i.e. a number is origami-constructible when there is a series of field extensions each with degree 2 or 3).

* In **hyperbolic geometry** define the Poincaré model of hyperbolic geometry - either the disc model or the half-plane model (or another model altogether), and show that is satisfies most of Euclid's axioms for geometry, but that the parallel postulate fails.

* In **model theory**: complete types of a language are defined in mathlib. Prove for a countable theory that if there are uncountably many types with `n` free variables, then there are continuum many. Or harder: show that in this case that the theory has continuum many non-isomorphic models.

* In **number theory**:
  - [taken] Define Carmichael numbers in Lean and formalize their basic theory, including Korselt's criterion. Prove that 561 is the smallest Carmichael number.
  - Prove the Hasse-Minkowski theorem for quadratic forms of the form `a_1*X_1^2 + a_2 * X_2^2`. If you have time, prove the `n = 3` case `(a_1*X_1^2 + a_2 * X_2^2 + a_3 * X_3^2)`.
  - Solve some diophantine equations. For example: show that there are no nonzero integer solutions to `x^4-y^4=z^2`. Find all solutions to `x^2+y^2=z^3` and to `|2^k-3^l|=1`.

* In **planar geometry** many results are missing. Choose one: the theorem of Ceva's theorem, Desargues's theorem, Feuerbach's theorem, Menelaus's theorem, Morley's trisecor theorem.

* In noncommutative **ring theory**: prove the Artin-Wedderburn Theorem (classification theorem for semisimple rings and algebras). This is listed as a TODO in `Mathlib.RingTheory.SimpleModule`.

* In **topology**:
  - [general topology] Define the adjunction space or pushout of topological spaces and prove topological properties and the universal property of this space.
  - [general topology] Define the Möbius strip and/or the Klein bottle and prove basic properties (e.g.: different constructions are equivalent; boundary of Möbius strip is connected and homotopy equivalent to `S¹`)
  Optional: prove they are smooth manifolds (with boundary).
  - [general topology] Define some spaces that are typically used for counterexamples, such as the Hawaiian earring, the long line, wild knots or the horned sphere, and (dis)prove some topological properties for them.
  - [algebraic topology] Mathlib has a definition of simplicial complexes. Define oriented simplices and simplicial homology (if useful you can define abstract simplicial complexes yourself and do it for that definition).

## Formalization Tips

Here are some tips for your project.

### Read relevant mathlib files

* There is a rough Mathlib overview here: https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-overview.html
  This can give you an idea what is already in Mathlib.
* Make sure you look through Mathlib what related concepts to your project already exists. It is useful to use https://leansearch.net/ for this
* Look at the related work in more detail in the Mathlib docs:
  https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/.
  For some results, opening the file in Lean will give you even more information.
* The link above is for the newest version of Mathlib. It is possible that some things have changed slightly since the course started. There is also a version of the documentation pages for the exact version of Mathlib this course uses, here: https://florisvandoorn.com/LeanCourse24/docs/
* Step through some of the proofs in Lean.
  You can open the file locally by going to e.g.
  `LeanCourse24/.lake/packages/mathlib/Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Basic.lean`
  Note that the `.lake` folder is hidden in VSCode sidebar, but you can navigate through it with `ctrl+O` or `cmd+O`.

### Searching

During class I already discussed searching using the name (using autocomplete or the mathlib docs), or the statement (using `apply?` or `rw?`). Additional options:

* Search Mathlib using natural language: https://leansearch.net/
* Search Mathlib using precise syntax: https://loogle.lean-lang.org/
* Searching on GitHub directly: https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4
  - This can be useful when searching for a mathematical theorems using its name,
    since the mathlib docs search doesn't search through the documentation of a definition or theorem (only its name).

### Asking for help

* If you have trouble with anything, make sure to ask the tutor or teacher for help during class or office hours.
* If you are stuck on something, try replacing it by `sorry` and move on to the next part until you can ask about it.

* You are allowed to ask any AI for help. I do not necessarily recommend using them,
  often their suggestions are not very helpful.
  * GitHub copilot can sometimes help with stating lemmas or proving a set.
  * ChatGPT knows some Lean, but it bad at proofs and often suggests outdated Lean 3 syntax

### Writing definitions

It is useful to find a definition that already exists in mathlib and is similar to what you want.
Then you can mimic the structure of that definition.
This can also be useful in deciding whether to use `def`, `structure` or `class`.

## Presentations

During January, you should give a presentation on your project during class.
The presentation should be 20-25 minutes, plus 5 minutes for questions; it should be 30-40 minutes if you do the project with a partner.

During your presentation, you can discuss the following (but you don't have to treat every point)
* Explain the mathematical content of your formalization
* Show some of the formalized work (for example if you have found interesting way to state a definition, or the statement of the theorem you proved).
* What went easily when formalizing? What was hard? Were any tools or tactics particularly useful, or did you miss a specific tactic?

You do not have to finish your project before your presentation, so your presentation is probably about the ongoing work.

## Handing in your project

Projects are due February 9 (roughly 1 week after classes end).
To "hand-in" your project, you just have to push to your fork of GitHub, and check that all the files show up on GitHub.

Your project should contain a short description of it contents, to help judge what you've formalized.
This should be included in the repository as a pdf or markdown file (not Word or rich text format).
Please answer the following questions:

* What are the main results in your formalization.
* Do you have any `sorry`'s or unfinished proofs? Describe what part (if any) is unfinished.
* What references/sources have you used?

In the next three exercises we will show that every continuous injective function `ℝ → ℝ` is
either strictly monotone or strictly antitone.

We start by proving a slightly harder version of the exercise in class.
We generalize the real numbers to an arbitrary type `α`
that satisfies all the conditions required for the intermediate value theorem.
If you want to prove this by using the intermediate value theorem only once,
then use `intermediate_value_uIcc`.
`uIcc a b` is the unordered interval `[min a b, max a b]`.
Useful lemmas: `uIcc_of_le` and `mem_uIcc`. -/

    (hab : a ≤ b) (h2ab : f a < f b) (hx : a ≤ x) : f a ≤ f x := by {
  sorry
  }

/- Now use this and the intermediate value theorem again
to prove that `f` is at least monotone on `[a, ∞)`. -/

  sorry
  }

Now we can finish just by using the previous exercise multiple times.
In this proof we take advantage that we did the previous exercise for an arbitrary order,
because that allows us to apply it to `ℝ` with the reversed order `≥`.
This is called `OrderDual ℝ`. This allows us to get that `f` is also strictly monotone on
`(-∞, b]`.
Now finish the proof yourself.
You do not need to apply the intermediate value theorem in this exercise.

Let's prove that the absolute value function is not differentiable at 0.
You can do this by showing that the left derivative and the right derivative do exist,
but are not equal. We can state this with `HasDerivWithinAt`
To make the proof go through, we need to show that the intervals have unique derivatives.
An example of a set that doesn't have unique derivatives is the set `ℝ × {0}`
as a subset of `ℝ × ℝ`, since that set doesn't contains only points in the `x`-axis,
so within that set there is no way to know what the derivative of a function should be
in the direction of the `y`-axis.

The following lemmas will be useful
* `HasDerivWithinAt.congr`
* `uniqueDiffWithinAt_convex`
* `HasDerivWithinAt.derivWithin`
* `DifferentiableAt.derivWithin`.

/- There are special cases of the change of variables theorems for affine transformations
(but you can also use the change of variable theorem from the lecture) -/
example (a b : ℝ) :
    ∫ x in a..b, sin (x / 2 + 3) =
    2 * cos (a / 2 + 3) - 2 * cos (b / 2  + 3) := by {

/- Use the change of variables theorem for this exercise. -/

example (x : ℝ) : ∫ t in (0)..x, t * exp t = (x - 1) * exp x + 1 := by {

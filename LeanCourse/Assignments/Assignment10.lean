Partial homeomorphisms are globally defined maps with a globally defined "inverse", but the only
relevant set is the *source*, which should be mapped homeomorphically to the *target*.

Define a partial homeomorphism from `‚Ñù` to `‚Ñù` which is just `x ‚Ü¶ -x`, but on `(-1, 1)`. In
Lean, the interval `(-1, 1)` is denoted by `Ioo (-1 : ‚Ñù) 1` (where `o` stands for _open_). -/

  toFun := fun x ‚Ü¶ -x
  invFun := fun x ‚Ü¶ -x
  source := Ioo (-1) 1

### Smooth functions on `[0, 1]`

We will prove two simple lemmas about smooth maps on `[0, 1]`.
These lemmas are easy, but are still quite some work in Lean,
because Mathlib is missing many lemmas about manifolds.
In particular, don't expect any lemma that is about closed submanifolds.

/- Smoothness results for `EuclideanSpace` are expressed for general `L^p` spaces
(as `EuclideanSpace` has the `L^2` norm), in: -/
#check PiLp.contDiff_coord
#check PiLp.contDiffOn_iff_coord

-- this is the charted space structure on `I`
#check IccManifold

/- You might want to use `contMDiff_iff` and unfold the definition of
`modelWithCornersEuclideanHalfSpace` (and some other functions) in the proof. -/

/-! # Exercises to practice. -/

/- Do the exercises about sets from last exercise set, if you haven't done them because
we didn't cover the material in class yet. -/


variable {α β γ ι : Type*} (f : α → β) (x : α) (s : Set α)

/- Prove this equivalence for sets. -/
example : s = univ ↔ ∀ x : α, x ∈ s := by {
  constructor
  · intro hs x
    rw [hs]
    exact trivial
  · intro h
    ext x
    exact (iff_true_right trivial).mpr (h x)
  }


/- Prove the law of excluded middle without using `by_cases`/`tauto` or lemmas from the library.
You will need to use `by_contra` in the proof. -/
lemma exercise3_1 (p : Prop) : p ∨ ¬ p := by {
  by_contra h
  push_neg at h
  exact (and_not_self_iff p).mp (id (And.symm h))
  }

/- `α × β` is the cartesian product of the types `α` and `β`.
Elements of the cartesian product are denoted `(a, b)`, and the projections are `.1` and `.2`.
As an example, here are two ways to state when two elements of the cartesian product are equal.
You can use the `ext` tactic to show that two pairs are equal.
`simp` can simplify `(a, b).1` to `a`.
This is true by definition, so calling `assumption` below also works directly. -/

example (a a' : α) (b b' : β) : (a, b) = (a', b') ↔ a = a' ∧ b = b' := Prod.ext_iff
example (x y : α × β) : x = y ↔ x.1 = y.1 ∧ x.2 = y.2 := Prod.ext_iff
example (a a' : α) (b b' : β) (ha : a = a') (hb : b = b') : (a, b) = (a', b') := by
  ext
  · simp
    assumption
  · assumption

/- To practice, show the equality of the following pair. What is the type of these pairs? -/
example (x y : ℝ) : (123 + 32 * 3, (x + y) ^ 2) = (219, x ^ 2 + 2 * x * y + y ^ 2) := by {
  sorry
  }

/- `A ≃ B` means that there is a bijection from `A` to `B`.
So in this exercise you are asked to prove that there is a bijective correspondence between
  functions from `ℤ × ℕ` to `ℤ × ℤ`
and
  functions from `ℕ` to `ℕ`
This is an exercise about finding lemmas from the library.
Your proof is supposed to only combine results from the library,
you are not supposed to define the bijection yourself.
If you want, you can use `calc` blocks with `≃`. -/
example : (ℤ × ℕ → ℤ × ℤ) ≃ (ℕ → ℕ) := by {
  sorry
  }

/- Prove a version of the axiom of choice Lean's `Classical.choose`. -/
example (C : ι → Set α) (hC : ∀ i, ∃ x, x ∈ C i) : ∃ f : ι → α, ∀ i, f i ∈ C i := by {
  sorry
  }


/-! # Exercises to hand-in. -/


/- ## Converging sequences

Prove two more lemmas about converging sequences. -/

/-- From the lecture, the sequence `u` of real numbers converges to `l`. -/
def SequentialLimit (u : ℕ → ℝ) (l : ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, |u n - l| < ε

/- Let's prove that reindexing a convergent sequence
by a reindexing function that tends to infinity
produces a sequence that converges to the same value. -/
lemma sequentialLimit_reindex {s : ℕ → ℝ} {r : ℕ → ℕ} {a : ℝ}
    (hs : SequentialLimit s a) (hr : ∀ m : ℕ, ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, r n ≥ m) :
    SequentialLimit (s ∘ r) a := by {
  unfold SequentialLimit at *
  simp
  intro ε hε
  specialize hs ε hε
  obtain ⟨M, hM⟩ := hs
  specialize hr M
  obtain ⟨N, hN⟩ := hr

  use N
  intro n₀ h
  have hrn : r n₀ ≥ M := by apply hN n₀ h
  apply hM (r n₀) hrn
  }


/- Let's prove the squeeze theorem for sequences.
You will want to use the lemma in the library that states
`|a| < b ↔ -b < a ∧ a < b`. -/
lemma sequentialLimit_squeeze {s₁ s₂ s₃ : ℕ → ℝ} {a : ℝ}
    (hs₁ : SequentialLimit s₁ a) (hs₃ : SequentialLimit s₃ a)
    (hs₁s₂ : ∀ n, s₁ n ≤ s₂ n) (hs₂s₃ : ∀ n, s₂ n ≤ s₃ n) :
    SequentialLimit s₂ a := by {
  unfold SequentialLimit at *
  intro ε hε
  specialize hs₁ ε hε
  specialize hs₃ ε hε
  obtain ⟨N₁, hN₁⟩ := hs₁
  obtain ⟨N₃, hN₃⟩ := hs₃

  use max N₁ N₃
  intro n hn
  have h1 := by apply hN₁ n (le_trans (le_max_left N₁ N₃) (hn))
  have h3 := by apply hN₃ n (le_trans (le_max_right N₁ N₃) (hn))
  rw [abs_lt] at *
  constructor
  · calc -ε < s₁ n - a := by apply h1.1
          _ ≤ s₂ n - a := by exact tsub_le_tsub_right (hs₁s₂ n) a
  · calc s₂ n - a ≤ s₃ n - a := by exact tsub_le_tsub_right (hs₂s₃ n) a
                _ < ε := by exact h3.2
  }

/- ## Sets -/

/- Prove this without using lemmas from Mathlib. -/
lemma image_and_intersection {α β : Type*} (f : α → β) (s : Set α) (t : Set β) :
    f '' s ∩ t = f '' (s ∩ f ⁻¹' t) := by {
  sorry
  }

/- Prove this by finding relevant lemmas in Mathlib. -/
lemma preimage_square :
    (fun x : ℝ ↦ x ^ 2) ⁻¹' {y | y ≥ 16} = { x : ℝ | x ≤ -4 } ∪ { x : ℝ | x ≥ 4 } := by {
  ext x
  simp
  have h1 : (16 : ℝ) = 4 ^ 2 := by ring
  rw [h1, sq_le_sq]
  simp
  exact le_abs'
  }

/- `InjOn` states that a function is injective when restricted to `s`.
`LeftInvOn g f s` states that `g` is a left-inverse of `f` when restricted to `s`.
Now prove the following example, mimicking the proof from the lecture.
If you want, you can define `g` separately first.
-/
lemma inverse_on_a_set [Inhabited α] (hf : InjOn f s) : ∃ g : β → α, LeftInvOn g f s := by {
  sorry
  }


/- Let's prove that if `f : α → γ` and `g : β → γ` are injective function whose
ranges partition `γ`, then `Set α × Set β` is in bijective correspondence to `Set γ`.

To help you along the way, some potentially useful ways to reformulate the hypothesis are given. -/

-- This lemma might be useful.
#check Injective.eq_iff

lemma set_bijection_of_partition {f : α → γ} {g : β → γ} (hf : Injective f) (hg : Injective g)
    (h1 : range f ∩ range g = ∅) (h2 : range f ∪ range g = univ) :
    ∃ (L : Set α × Set β → Set γ) (R : Set γ → Set α × Set β), L ∘ R = id ∧ R ∘ L = id := by {
  -- h1' and h1'' might be useful later as arguments of `simp` to simplify your goal.
  have h1' : ∀ x y, f x ≠ g y := by sorry
  have h1'' : ∀ y x, g y ≠ f x := by sorry
  have h2' : ∀ x, x ∈ range f ∪ range g := by sorry
  let L : Set α × Set β → Set γ := sorry
  let R : Set γ → Set α × Set β := sorry
